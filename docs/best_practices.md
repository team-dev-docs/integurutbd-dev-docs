Integuru is a powerful tool for automating integrations and API workflows. To get the most out of Integuru, follow these best practices for preparing input data, optimizing the integration process, interpreting results, and working with language models.

## Preparing Input Data

1. **Clean and Format HAR Files**: Ensure your HAR (HTTP Archive) files are clean, up-to-date, and contain all relevant API calls for your integration.

2. **Organize Cookie Information**: Properly structure and format your cookie data in the designated cookie file to ensure accurate authentication and session management.

3. **Define Clear Input Variables**: When setting up your integration, clearly define and document all input variables that may be required across different API calls.

4. **Use Descriptive Prompts**: Create clear and concise prompts that accurately describe the integration task you want to accomplish.

## Optimizing the Integration Process

1. **Start with Simple Workflows**: Begin with straightforward integrations and gradually increase complexity as you become more familiar with Integuru's capabilities.

2. **Leverage the DAG Structure**: Understand and utilize the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure that Integuru uses to manage dependencies between API calls.

3. **Minimize Dynamic Parts**: Where possible, reduce the number of dynamic parts in your API calls to simplify the integration process and improve reliability.

4. **Use Input Variables Effectively**: Make use of input variables to create more flexible and reusable integration workflows.

5. **Handle Cookies Properly**: Pay attention to how cookies are managed, especially for authentication-heavy integrations.

## Interpreting Results

1. **Analyze the DAG Output**: Carefully review the generated DAG to understand the flow and dependencies of your integration.

2. **Check Dynamic Parts Identification**: Verify that Integuru has correctly identified dynamic parts in your API calls, and make adjustments if necessary.

3. **Review Input Variable Usage**: Ensure that input variables are being utilized correctly throughout the integration process.

4. **Examine Error Nodes**: Pay special attention to any "not found" nodes in the DAG, as these may indicate areas where the integration process needs refinement.

## Working with Language Models

1. **Choose the Appropriate Model**:
   - Use the default `gpt-4o` model for most tasks, as it provides a good balance of performance and capability.
   - Switch to the `o1-preview` model for more complex integrations or when you need enhanced reasoning capabilities.
   - Be aware that reverting to the default model may degrade performance for certain tasks.

2. **Structuring Prompts**:
   - Be specific and detailed in your prompts to get the best results from the language model.
   - Include relevant context, such as API documentation or specific requirements, in your prompts.
   - Use the provided function definitions to guide the model's output format.

3. **Optimize Model Usage**:
   - Leverage the `LLMSingleton` class to manage model instances efficiently.
   - Use the `switch_to_alternate_model()` method when you need to temporarily use a different model for specific tasks.

4. **Fine-tune Temperature Settings**:
   - The default temperature is set to 1, which allows for more creative responses.
   - For tasks requiring more deterministic output, consider lowering the temperature.

By following these best practices, you can maximize the effectiveness of Integuru in automating your API integrations and workflows. Remember to continuously refine your approach based on the specific requirements of your integration tasks and the feedback you receive from the system.
